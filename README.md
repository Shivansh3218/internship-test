# Getting Started with Create React App

## Steps followed to create the app are as follows -: 

-First I created a react app by using create-react-app command.\
-Then I installed axios to fetch the data from api.\
-I created a state using useState hook to store data coming from api.\
-I used an async function to call the api through axios and store it in the state.\
-Mapped the data in the ui to create seperate cards of username and email.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
